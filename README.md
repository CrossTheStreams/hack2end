Haystack
========

Haystack is the result of a project worked on during the [Hack to End Homelessness](http://www.hacktoendhomelessness.com/) in May, 2014. The goal of the project is to facilitate the analysis of Point in Time counts (also known as One Night Counts), which are performed around the country in January of each year to quantify the number of people living unsheltered in our communities.

You may view the currently deployed version of this project at [http://haystack-hack2end.herokuapp.com/](http://haystack-hack2end.herokuapp.com/).
